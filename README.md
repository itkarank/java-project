# PROVISIONSING AWS INFRASTRUCTURE USING [TERRAFORM]

# VIRTUAL SERVER [EC2]

* I've provisioned two EC2 instances named production-server and CI/CD-server.
  production-server is likely intended to serve as a production environment for hosting application.
  CI/CD-server is presumably designated for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying application.

# VIRTUAL NETWORK [VPC]

* created a VPC and subnets and internet gateway and route tables for ec2 instances.
  Then associated IGW with VPC and i have done subnet association.

# VIRTUAL FIREWALL [security group]

* created a security group for ec2 instaces.
